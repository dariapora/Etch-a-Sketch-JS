# Etch-a-Sketch
This repository contains my solution for the [Etch-a-Sketch assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) of TOP Foundations. 
## What I Learned
**Dynamic Grid Creation** – Built a fully responsive drawing grid where the number of rows and columns updates based on the `gridSld` slider input, using event listeners.\
**Flexbox** – Got more comfortable using Flexbox and mastered its fundamental concepts.\
**Event Handling** – Implemented event listeners for grid drawing, brush/eraser toggling, and color selection.
